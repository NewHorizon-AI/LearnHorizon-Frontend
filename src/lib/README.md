# Lib Directory

## Overview

The `lib` directory contains various libraries and modules that are integral to the application but stand apart from the core business logic. These libraries are designed to be reusable and often interact with external systems or handle complex logic that is abstracted away from the main application flow.

## Contents

- `apiClient`: A configured instance of Axios for making HTTP requests.
- `database`: Abstractions for database interactions, possibly using ORM.
- `auth`: Authentication utilities for handling user authentication and authorization.

## Usage

Modules in the `lib` folder are imported where necessary throughout the application. They are designed to be self-contained and manage specific aspects of the application such as data fetching, state management, or third-party service integration.
