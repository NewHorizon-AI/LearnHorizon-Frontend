# Utils Directory

## Overview

The `utils` directory is a collection of utility functions that are used across the application to perform various common tasks such as data formatting, validation checks, and minor data manipulations. These utilities are designed to be lightweight and generic, providing helper functions that simplify the main business logic.

## Contents

- `formatDate`: Function to format dates consistently across the application.
- `validators`: Common validation functions for data integrity checks.
- `stringHelpers`: Functions to manipulate and adjust strings.

## Usage

Utility functions are imported and used throughout the application wherever small, common tasks need to be performed. They are kept generic and independent from any specific application logic to maximize reusability.
